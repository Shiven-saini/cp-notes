## What is a Data structure ?

It's a particular way of arranging a data so it can be stored and operated upon much more efficiently.

DS can be either *primitive* (string, bool, int, float, double etc) or *non-primitive* (Arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks & queues). 

Sets, multipleset, tuples, pair & vector are some other types of DS.

## What is an Algorithm ?

Algorithm is basically just a way of thinking or approaching a problem. There can be a many approach for a single problem, one of them might be better than other in terms of **memory** & **time-requirements.**

**Formally,** a set of steps for solving a known problem.
Examples :- Sorting, searching, encrypting, hashing, greedy algorithms, brute force and a lot more.
